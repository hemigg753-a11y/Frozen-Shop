The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive Frozen Shop application for selling game accounts, primarily Fortnite. Initially, it implemented core features like account creation (secured by a code ), display, and deletion. A robust login system was added, differentiating between an admin user () with full control and regular users with view/purchase access. The chat system evolved from a basic email notification to a full WhatsApp-style admin interface, allowing the admin to manage multiple conversations, reply to users, and even ban/delete chats via a right-click context menu. Payment options were significantly expanded to include various local and cryptocurrency methods, with email notifications for purchases. The UI underwent several stylistic changes per user requests, eventually reverting to the original dark, gradient theme. The last reported issue by the user was the code is not working after the payment integration, which the AI is currently debugging, suspecting a state or session management problem.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a website for selling game accounts (specifically Fortnite) called Frozen Shop (initially Gaming Shop).
**Core Features:**
1.  **Account Management:** Ability to upload new accounts with an  code, including an image, price, and description. Accounts should be displayable on the main page, similar to .
2.  **User Interface:** Initially a black, white, and gray background, later updated to a space image, and then reverted to the original dark gradient theme. Modern button styles and Shadcn UI components.
3.  **Purchase System:** A Buy Now button that opens a detailed purchase modal.
    *   Initial payment options: PayPal, Digital Currency, Bank Transfer.
    *   Later expanded to include: Bit (0542609941), PayBox (0536273764), Cash Cash (LMGusDqQyqm6CxnL4v1A2Zcy9RF8R7Wr8P), Litecoin (bc1qs7yzmg5jaf3j25fwuu4a6azrj9ehcvuvck3nfy), and Bitcoin.
    *   Admin () must receive an email notification upon a successful purchase.
4.  **Admin/User System:**
    *   Email-based login is required to access the site.
    *    is designated as the admin with full permissions.
    *   Admin permissions: adding/deleting accounts, full chat management.
    *   Regular user permissions: viewing accounts, purchasing, chatting with admin.
5.  **Chat System:**
    *   A Chat with Admin button should be available.
    *   Initially, messages sent in chat should trigger an email to .
    *   Later, the admin should have a WhatsApp-style interface to manage multiple concurrent chats with different users, view chat history, and reply directly.
    *   Admin should receive an email notification for new user messages.
    *   Admin should have a right-click context menu on chat conversations to Delete Chat or Ban User.
    *   Banned users should be prevented from sending messages.

The user reported that הקוד לא עובד (The code is not working) in relation to the payment system after its latest updates. The AI is currently investigating this bug. There are no new feature requests pending.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a user-reported issue where the code is not working. This report came after the implementation of new payment methods (Bit, PayBox, Cash Cash, Bitcoin, Litecoin) and the functionality to send an email notification to the admin upon a successful purchase.

The AI's debugging steps included:
1.  Checking the backend server logs, which indicated the server was running without errors and that the  and  endpoints were returning  for purchase requests.
2.  Verifying the frontend compilation, which was successful.
3.  Taking screenshots of the application, which showed:
    *   The login screen working correctly.
    *   The main page with accounts displayed correctly after login.
    *   The purchase modal with all the newly added payment methods (Bit, PayBox, Cash Cash, Bitcoin, Litecoin) visible and correctly formatted.
4.  Observing an issue after a purchase attempt where the purchase modal closed, but the user was redirected to the login screen, with the chat modal visible in the background. This suggests a potential problem with session management or state persistence after certain user actions.

The AI engineer's last explicit action was to ask the user for clarification on what specific part of the code not working report refers to, listing potential areas like emails not actually sending (since it's logged, not real SMTP), purchase not saving, or the payment screen not opening, and stated it would re-check backend endpoints.

The next step is to obtain specific clarification from the user regarding the exact functionality that is not working, as observed after the payment flow.
